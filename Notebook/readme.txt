A recommender system is a tool used to utilized to forecast the inclination of a user for a specific item. Matrix Factorization is one of the most extensively employed and well-known techniques for constructing a Recommender System. This approach has been proven to be efficacious in numerous practical applications and has been employed in a variety of domains, including films, literature, songs, and electronic commerce. In this paper, we attempted to conduct a bias-minimized analysis of latent feature factorization and achieved successful results in small datasets. Our findings suggest that when studying a smaller segment of users, it is not necessary to incorporate all biases, resulting in lower computational costs. We also discussed the issue caused by cold start i.e., whenever a new user is available in the system, and possible solutions to address the issue of cold start.
